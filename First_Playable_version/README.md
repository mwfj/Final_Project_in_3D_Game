# Game Mechanics

Control charater to find three switches. When all the switch turned on, the boss room will open(there is nothing in the boss room now, and we will add boss in the boss room in the future)

Also,the current switches in the game are temporary, in the future we will replace these switches with other items.  We will add attack mode in the future to enable character fight with boss.
